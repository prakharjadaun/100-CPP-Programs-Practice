# **C/C++ Programs - Practice**

This repository contains all the practice programs that I have implemented in C/C++. As one should always adhere to the basics, these are some basic programs each programmer should know :

1. Program to find Fibonacci numbers.
2. Check if a number is prime or not.
3. Check if number is palindrome or not.
4. Find factorial of the number.
5. Check if a number is Armstrong number.
