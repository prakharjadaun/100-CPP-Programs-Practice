7. Reverse a number.
8. Swap Numbers in C.
9. Program without main.
10. Program for decimal to binary.
11. Check if number is positive or negative
12. Program to find greatest of 3 numbers.
13. Program to get ascii value.
14. Program to demonstrate sizeof function.
15. Program to check for leap year.
